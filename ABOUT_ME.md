background (science)
------
I started working in a neuroimaging lab 6 years ago where I picked up a lot of skills in the realm of structural imaging and basic scripting. Feel free to come hang out with me if you want to learn about:
- T1 structural processing (humans, non-human primates, rodents)
  - including image registration, creating custom segmentation labels, brain surfaces, etc
  - using BrainSuite, FreeSurfer, ANTs, CIVET, FSL
- DWI pre/processing
  - mainly using BrainSuite but dabbling in mrtrix3 / dipy / FSL
- Dataset wrangling (converting DICOM images, organising data, etc)
- basic BASH scripting
- scanning live mice :mouse:ðŸ§ 
- how to manage undergrad volunteers

background (misc)

I also exist in a realm beyond that of neuroimaging / my PhD (shocking, I know) so if you want to chat about plants, climbing, crochet, Los Angeles, doughnuts, how modern educational systems are failing our youth or scientific outreach (among other topics), I would be v happy to make friends.
