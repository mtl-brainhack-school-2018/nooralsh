I'm trying to learn how to:
-----

#### + Preprocess resting-state fMRI data
**using NIAK, fMRIprep (& Docker) and/or CPAC**

In addition to never having preprocessed an fMRI scan before, I have some extra "fun" issues with some of my scans (orientation/distortion) that need to be resolved. My data come from different scanners and locations which might mean using a different preprocessing pipelines/parameters per scanner.

#### + Analyse connectivity data
**structural and functional connectivity using DWI + rsfMRI**

I know very little about connectivity analysis and how to run my own stats on them -- why to choose certain tests over others, what they represent, etc. but it's what I want to do my PhD project in! So would be nice to know at least something about it.

#### + Batch-processing on Compute Canada
I need to run a lot of jobs on CC (cedar/graham) and would like to know some of the specific parameters to use with proper batch-processing etiquette.
